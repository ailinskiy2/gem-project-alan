# Gesture Detection Using AI

## Objective

Implement pedestrian gesture recognition using the Google Gemini AI model to distinguish between:

- Dynamic gestures: waving or other active hand movements.
- Static poses: pedestrian standing without significant motion.

## Camera Setup

- Stereo camera system for enhanced depth perception and accurate tracking.

## Why Google Gemini 2.0 Multimodal API?

The Google Gemini 2.0 Multimodal API specifically enables real-time streaming of video footage, allowing the AI to analyze live visual data and accurately identify pedestrian actions and gestures as they occur.
